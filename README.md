# Summary

UD Indonesian-CSUI is a conversion from an Indonesian constituency treebank in the Penn Treebank format named [**Kethu**](https://github.com/ialfina/kethu) that was also a conversion from a constituency treebank named [**idn-treebank**](https://github.com/famrashel/idn-treebank). 
We named this treebank **Indonesian-CSUI**, since all the three versions of the treebanks were built at Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia.


# Introduction

This Indonesian-CSUI treebank was converted automatically from the Kethu treebank, an Indonesian constituency treebank in the Penn Treebank format. This treebank consists of 1030 sentences and 28,228 words. The Kethu treebank itself was converted from a consituency treebank using semi-manual approach. The bracketing conversion was automatic, but the revising of POS tagging and some syntactic annotation was done manually.

Other characteristics of the treebank:
* The genre of the sentences are mainly news in formal Indonesian. 
* Average of sentence length is around 27 words per-sentence, which is very high compare to Indonesian-PUD treebank that has average sentence length of 19.4.


# Acknowledgments

* The original constituency treebank named [**idn-treebank**](https://github.com/famrashel/idn-treebank) was built with manual annotation by Arawinda Dinakaramani, Fam Rashel, Andry Luthfi, and Ruli Manurung from Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia in 2015.
* The idn-treebank was converted to the Penn Treebank format by Ika Alfina and Jessica Naraiswari Arwidarasti from Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia in 2019. This PTB version of the _idn-treebank_ was named [**Kethu**](https://github.com/ialfina/kethu).
* The Kethu treebank was converted to a UD treebank by Ika Alfina and Jessica Naraiswari Arwidarasti
